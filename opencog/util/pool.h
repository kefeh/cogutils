//! Thread-safe blocking resource allocator.
/// If there are no resources to borrow, then the borrow() method will
/// block until one is given back.
///
/// This maintains a finite-sized pool of resources, which can be
/// borrowed and returned, much like a libary book.  As long as the
/// pool is not empty, resources can be borrowed. If the pool is empty,
/// (there is nothing to be borrowed), then the borrowing thread will
/// block, until such time as the pool becomes non-empty.  When a
/// resource is returned, one of the blocked threads will be woken up,
/// and given the resource. Wakeups are in arbitrary order, and not
/// in any particular order (the thread waiting the longest is not
/// necessarily the one that gets woken up).
///
/// To start things off, resources need to be added to the pool.  This
/// can be done at any time at all: even after borrowers are lined up.
/// Resources can be permanently removed, simply by borrowing them and
/// never returning them.
///
/// A typical usage would be to create the pool in some master thread,
/// call `give_back()` N times to place N items in the pool, and then
/// let other threads start borrowing.  Alternately, other threads
/// can start borrowing right away; they'll block until someone puts
/// something into the pool.
///
/// Although you might think that boost::pool already does this, you'd
/// be wrong.  It would appear that the author of boost::pool did not
/// understand the problem that needed to be solved.
///
/// This is similar to concurrent_queue (also in this directory) but
/// with a simpler, less sophisticated API.  The main difference is that
/// this API uses named that make it clear that resources are being
/// borrowed, and returned, whereas the concurrent_queue has an API that
/// is geared towards the producer-consumer mode of thinking.
//
// This is implemented on top of std::queue, for no particular reason;
// pretty much any other container would do.
