//! Represents a thread-safe first in-first out list.
///
/// Implements a thread-safe queue: any thread can push stuff onto the
/// queue, and any other thread can remove stuff from it.  If the queue
/// is empty, the thread attempting to remove stuff will block.  If the
/// queue is empty, and something is added to the queue, and there is
/// some thread blocked on the queue, then that thread will be woken up.
///
/// The function provided here is almost identical to that provided by
/// the pool class (also in this directory), but with a fancier API that
/// allows cancellation, and other minor utilities. This API is also
/// most easily understood as a producer-consumer API, with producer
/// threads adding stuff to the queue, and consumer threads removing
/// them.  By contrast, the pool API is a borrow-and-return API, which
/// is really more-or-less the same thing, but just uses a different
/// mindset.  This API also matches the proposed C++ standard for this
/// basic idea.
